1. Create sample dataset files for S and R using data generator:
hadoop jar /path/to/svm_scale/dist/svm_scale.jar 10 5 4 7 1.0 1 S R

2. Load each of S and R to its own folder on HDFS:
hdfs dfs -put S /hdfs/path/to/S
hdfs dfs -put R /hdfs/path/to/R

3. Create external tables for Hive to register S and R:
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE textS(sid int, forkey int, label double, xs array<double>) row format delimited fields terminated by ' ' collection items terminated by ',' lines terminated by '\n' stored as textfile location '/hdfs/path/to/S';
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE textR(rid int, xr array<double>) row format delimited fields terminated by ' ' collection items terminated by ',' lines terminated by '\n' stored as textfile location '/hdfs/path/to/R';
